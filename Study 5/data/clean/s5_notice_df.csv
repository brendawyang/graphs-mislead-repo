I also noticed that some of the data wasn't really appropriate for bar graphs (would have been more easily understood as a line graph, especially change over time graphs), and the units varied widely and were often deceptive/not equidistant.",0,0,1,0,
s51226,no warning,Humanities,"There were definitely some visual tricks with them. It was hard to remember graph to graph how I had rated the previous one: so for some, twice the amount seemed like a really big difference, but it is harder to conceptualize billions of something.

s51268,no warning,Humanities,"I noticed how widely the values on the y-axis changed and used that to mostly answer (ie is the difference split between 3 percentage points, or between hundreds of millions of dollars?).

s51035,no warning,Quantitative,The y-axis didn't start always start at 0 so looking at the scales was important.,1,1,1,1,
s51049,no warning,Quantitative,"I noticed that the scaling of the y axis varied substantially across graphs. Depending on the scaling, this magnified or diminished the apparent visual difference between bars. To prevent the scaling from biasing my judgments too much, I tried to visually estimate the absolute value for the categories and mentally compute a ratio between them. I calibrated the rating scale to different ratio values, e.g. a value around 1.1X was rated a 2, 1.25X=3, 1.5X=4, 1.75X=5, 2X=6, and &gt;2X= 7. I generally didn't take into account the nature of the data being presented.",1,1,1,1,

s51067,no warning,Quantitative,"Some of the graphs had y-axes that began at zero, whereas others did not. I also assume that the experiment manipulated factors such as visual distance between bars, relative distance between bars (e.g., intentionally similar or dissimilar ""distractor"" bars), and the mapping of physical/relative distances to numerical values, but I certainly couldn't reverse-engineer the experimental design.",1,1,1,1,
s51084,no warning,Quantitative,scaling seems off/truncated sometimes?,1,1,1,1,
s51086,no warning,Quantitative,"The graphs varied in thickness, I think that will introduce a bias in my judgement. The scale on the y-axis was also rarely starting at zero, tricking me into thinking things are more different than they actually are.

s51109,no warning,Quantitative,Anchoring bias and the scale sometimes made differences look larger than they were,1,1,1,1,

s51114,no warning,Quantitative,Scaling of some of them was very misleading,1,1,1,1,
s51140,no warning,Quantitative,"The graphs had y-axes that were measured in various units (billions, thousands, percentages, etc.). Also, many of the graphs began from y = 0, but also many of them did not: some restricted the range of the y-axis to be within a range [a,b]",1,1,1,1,
s51144,no warning,Quantitative,"There were never standard error bars. On some graphs, the range of y-values was very large and on some it was very small.",1,1,1,1,
s51165,no warning,Humanities,"I mean, graphs can be tricky in that smaller increments on the y-axis will make a difference appear greater, whereas smaller increments will make a difference appear smaller. When I read graphs, I try to be attuned to that fact. I also pay attention to the ""in thousands"" or ""in millions"" and base my own judgments of the graphs partially off how great I think the difference would be in the larger scheme of things. So, context is a part of it for me. So in a lot of ways, I think graphs are very useful, but they should not stand alone; each one tells a story in the way that it is constructed, so it's important to not take them at face value and to pay attention to the framing.",1,1,1,1,

s51171,no warning,Humanities,"The types of information they conveyed were quite varied and the difference between marks on the y-axis changed often. The word ""different"" changed drastically in meaning depending on the graph. For example, with regards to the graph about how many states were in the union, a difference of even one state is pretty significant. However, with regards to the graph about police killings, whether police kill 100 or 200 people doesn't make much of a difference to me.",1,1,1,1,coder 1 changed from 0 to 1

s51241,no warning,Humanities,"My impulse each time was to ""take in"" the visual relationship, but then I'd look at the amounts on the left column each time, and so often the visual variation felt meaningless or misleading after that. If this were data I'd need, I'd just prefer a list of amounts in increasing order in some cases. Also, for comparisons in populations, I wasn't sure how meaningful the amounts are. For instance, of for a given experience, if Japan is at 10 million ppl and India is at 7 million, there are so many additonal Qs I have when trying to decided how disparate the amounts are since the two nations' total pops are so different and what does that mean for their art-museum tastes or whatever. Also, I'm a humanist, and almost never have to deal with graphs, so grain of salt on all of the above I suppose.",1,1,1,1,coder 1 changed from 0 to 1
s51254,no warning,Humanities,It appears to be a lot easier to make small differences look like large differences by fiddling with the y-axis than it is to make large differences look like small differences. All you have to do for the former is make the y-axis a very small range.,1,1,1,1,
