# Study 3 Introduction

This Markdown documents the process to analyze the data for Study 3 which looked at the difference between those who received and those who did not receive a warning at the beginning of the study. 

Data was collected on July 19, 2018 by using Amazon's Mechanical Turk for distribution and Qualtrics as a survey platform. 

This HTML was last knitted on: `r Sys.time()`

### Exclusions

You can exclude subjects who did not get the correct answer in the exercise by changing Exclude_Exercise_Check (line 100) to TRUE. The next time you run all the code, these participants will be excluded. 

```{r}
Exclude_Exercise_Check <- FALSE

participants_excluded <- demographic_df %>% 
  filter(check == "wrong") %>% 
  group_by(check) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

if(Exclude_Exercise_Check == TRUE){rating_df <- rating_df %>% 
  filter(check == "right" | subject_condition == "no warning")
} else{rating_df <- rating_df}

if(Exclude_Exercise_Check == TRUE){demographic_df <- demographic_df %>% 
  filter(check == "right"| subject_condition == "no warning")
} else{demographic_df <- demographic_df}

```

For this report, **`r if(Exclude_Exercise_Check == FALSE){paste("no")} else{paste(participants_excluded$n)}`** participants are being excluded from analysis.

# Methods

### Participants

```{r general participant information}
n <- demographic_df %>% 
  summarise(n())
```

```{r general participant information gender}
gender <- demographic_df %>% 
  group_by(dem_gender) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

gender
  
```

```{r general participant information age}
age <- demographic_df %>% 
  summarise(mean_age = mean(dem_age), sd_age = sd(dem_age), 
            median_age = median(dem_age), min_age= min(dem_age), 
            max_age = max(dem_age), range_age = max(dem_age)-min(dem_age))

age
```

We recruited `r text_spec(n, bold = T)` Mturk workers (`r text_spec(gender[gender$dem_gender == "female",]$n, bold = T)` women, `r text_spec(gender[gender$dem_gender == "other",]$n, bold = T)` non-binary gender; M~age~ = `r text_spec(round(age$mean_age, 2), bold = T)` years, SD~age~ = `r text_spec(round(age$sd_age, 2), bold = T)`) participated in Study 3. All participants reported the United States as their location and had a previous task approval rate that was equal to or exceeded 85%. 

```{r general participant information education}
education <- demographic_df %>% 
  group_by(dem_ed) %>% 
  summarise (n = n()) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n)*100)

education
```

`r text_spec(round(sum(education[education$dem_ed >= 5,]$percentage)), bold = T)`% of participants reported having at least Bachelorâ€™s degree. The samples also exhibited a range of graph literacy.


```{r summary statistics for graph literacy}
#Cronbach's Alpha
library(psych)

alpha <- graphliteracy_df %>% 
  spread(graphliteracy_question, rating) %>% 
  select(-group) %>% 
  psych::alpha()

#Data Summary
subject_graphliteracy_summary <- subject_graphliteracy_df %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), 
            mean = mean(graphliteracy_sum_rating), 
            sd = sd(graphliteracy_sum_rating), 
            median = median(graphliteracy_sum_rating),
            min= min(graphliteracy_sum_rating), 
            max = max(graphliteracy_sum_rating), 
            range=max(graphliteracy_sum_rating)-min(graphliteracy_sum_rating)) %>% 
  mutate(alpha = round(alpha$total$std.alpha,2))

subject_graphliteracy_summary
```

### Exercise Check

```{r}
exercise_check <- rating_df %>% 
  filter(subject_condition == "warning") %>% 
  group_by(participantID, check) %>% 
  summarise(n()) %>% 
  group_by(check) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n)*100)
```

`r text_spec(exercise_check[exercise_check$check == "wrong",]$n, bold = T)` did not get the manipulation check question right. `r text_spec(round(exercise_check[exercise_check$check == "right",]$percentage,2), bold = T)`% of the participants in the warning condition answered the training exercise question correctly.

For this report, **`r if(Exclude_Exercise_Check == FALSE){paste("no")} else{paste(participants_excluded$n)}`** participants are being excluded from analysis. If you want to see results when participants who got the exercise wrong are excluded/included, you can go to the section called Exclusions (at the top of this file) and change **Exclude_Exercise_Check <- TRUE**


## Results

To preview, Figure 5 summarizes our primary results of interest: we replicate a truncation effect, and find that it is reduced but still present when an explanatory warning is given.

### Truncation effect


```{r summary statistics for graph ratings}
#Summarize Accross Subjects
subject_mean_summary <- subject_mean_df %>% 
  group_by(graph_condition) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), mean = mean(subject_mean_rating), 
            sd = sd(subject_mean_rating), 
            median = median(subject_mean_rating),
            min= min(subject_mean_rating), max = max(subject_mean_rating), 
            range =max(subject_mean_rating)-min(subject_mean_rating))

subject_mean_summary
  
```

We first replicated our central effect of interest: the truncation effect. As in Studies 1 and 2, we found that truncated bar graphs exaggerated ratings of differences, compared to control bar graphs: M~control~ = `r text_spec(round(subject_mean_summary[subject_mean_summary$graph_condition == "control",]$mean,2), bold = T)`, SD~control~ = `r text_spec(round(subject_mean_summary[subject_mean_summary$graph_condition == "control",]$sd,2), bold = T)`); M~truncated~ = `r text_spec(round(subject_mean_summary[subject_mean_summary$graph_condition == "truncated",]$mean,2), bold = T)`, SD~truncated~ = `r text_spec(round(subject_mean_summary[subject_mean_summary$graph_condition == "truncated",]$sd,2), bold = T)`.  

```{r effect size for graph ratings}
cohen_d <- effsize::cohen.d(subject_mean_df$subject_mean_rating, subject_mean_df$graph_condition, paired = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE)

cohen_d
```

```{r t test for graph ratings}
t_test <- t.test(subject_mean_rating ~ graph_condition, subject_mean_df, paired = TRUE)

t_test

```

This main effect was statistically significant (equal variances not assumed): t(`r text_spec(round(t_test$parameter,2), bold = T)`) = `r text_spec(abs(round(t_test$statistic,2)), bold = T)`, p < `r text_spec(format(t_test$p.value, scientific = T), bold = T)`, 95% CI of difference = [0.57, 0.83],  d = `r text_spec(abs(round(cohen_d$estimate,2)), bold = T)`. 

```{r}
subject_difference_summary <- subject_difference_df %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), mean = mean(difference), 
            sd = sd(difference), 
            median = median(difference),
            min= min(difference), max = max(difference), 
            range =max(difference)-min(difference))
```


M~difference~ = `r text_spec(round(subject_difference_summary$mean,2), bold = T)`. 


```{r truncation effect direction}
truncation_effect_direction <- subject_difference_df %>% 
  mutate(direction = ifelse(difference > 0, "expected", "unexpected")) %>%
  group_by(direction) %>% 
  summarise(n= n()) %>% 
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n)*100)

truncation_effect_direction           
```

This effect was consistent: `r text_spec(round(truncation_effect_direction[truncation_effect_direction$direction == "expected",]$percentage), bold = T)`% (`r text_spec(round(truncation_effect_direction[truncation_effect_direction$direction == "expected",]$n), bold = T)` of `r text_spec(n, bold = T)`) participants showed a truncated effect in the expected direction.

Next, we computed a linear mixed effects model with graph type (0 = control, 1 = truncated) and warning condition (0 = no warning, 1 = warning) as binary fixed factors. Participants' ratings of the differences depicted by bar graphs was the outcome variable, and participant was included a random effect.There was a statistically significant main effect of graph type and a statistically significant interaction between graph type and warning (Table 2).

```{r general models}
# predicting rating with subject and graph condition
model1 <- lmer(rating ~ subject_condition * graph_condition + (1 | participantID), models_df)

summary(model1)

##Model
summary_model1 <- summary(model1)
summary_model1 <- as.data.frame(summary_model1$coefficients)
```


We note that the intercept in this model (`r text_spec(round(summary_model1[1,1],2), bold = T)`) corresponds to ratings for control graphs with no explanatory warning given, acting as a theoretical and practical baseline for ratings on a 7-point scale.


### Table 2
```{r Table 2}
#Table 2
##Confidence Intervals
ci_model1 <- confint(model1, "beta_", level = 0.95, method = c("boot"), nsim = 1000,  seed = 833, boot.type = c("perc"), FUN=NULL, quiet=FALSE, oldNames = TRUE)
ci_model1 <- as.data.frame(ci_model1)


## Create and Clean Table
table2 <- merge(summary_model1, ci_model1, by = "row.names")
numVars <- sapply(table2, is.numeric)
table2[numVars][,-c(5)] <- lapply(table2[numVars][,-c(5)], round, digits = 2)
table2[c(6)] <- lapply(table2[c(6)], round, digits = 5)

table2 %<>% 
  mutate("95% CI of Estimate" =  paste("[", `2.5 %`, ",", `97.5 %`, "]", sep = "")) %>% select(Row.names, Estimate, `95% CI of Estimate`, `Std. Error`, `t value`, `Pr(>|t|)`)

table2
```


### Effect of an explanatory warning. 

Critically, we found that a warning reduces the size of the truncation effect by lowering ratings of truncated graphs selectively. This was revealed by a statistically significant interaction between graph type and warning condition (b = `r text_spec(table2$Estimate[4], bold = T)`; Table 2), such that participants who received an explanatory warning judged differences to be smaller for truncated graphs.


```{r table 2 excluding}
#Exclude participants
excluding_df <- rating_df %>% 
  filter(check == "right" | subject_condition == "no warning")

# predicting rating with subject and graph condition
model1_excluding <- lmer(rating ~ subject_condition * graph_condition + (1 | participantID), excluding_df)

##Model
summary_model1_excluding <- summary(model1_excluding)
summary_model1_excluding <- as.data.frame(summary_model1_excluding$coefficients)

#Table 2 Excluding
##Confidence Intervals Excluding
ci_model1_excluding <- confint(model1_excluding, "beta_", level = 0.95, method = c("boot"), nsim = 1000,  seed = 833, boot.type = c("perc"), FUN=NULL, quiet=FALSE, oldNames = TRUE)
ci_model1_excluding <- as.data.frame(ci_model1_excluding)


## Create and Clean Table Excluding
table2_excluding <- merge(summary_model1_excluding, ci_model1_excluding, by = "row.names")
numVars <- sapply(table2_excluding, is.numeric)
table2_excluding[numVars][,-c(5)] <- lapply(table2_excluding[numVars][,-c(5)], round, digits = 3)
table2_excluding[c(6)] <- lapply(table2_excluding[c(6)], round, digits = 5)

table2_excluding %<>% 
  mutate("95% CI of Estimate" =  paste("[", `2.5 %`, ",", `97.5 %`, "]", sep = "")) %>% select(Row.names, Estimate, `95% CI of Estimate`, `Std. Error`, `t value`, `Pr(>|t|)`)

```


We found mixed evidence for a global decrease in judgments following a warning, which would be revealed as a main effect for warning condition. This main effect is not statistically significant in Table 2. However, when we exclude 10 participants who did not initially answer our instructional item correctly (before feedback) from analyses, we do find a statistically significant main effect of Warning Condition, such that participants are globally more conservative for all graph types (b = `r text_spec(table2_excluding$Estimate[3],  bold = T)`, SE = `r text_spec(table2_excluding$"Std. Error"[3], bold = T)`, t = `r text_spec(table2_excluding$"t value"[3],  bold = T)`, p = `r text_spec(format(table2_excluding$"Pr(>|t|)"[3],scientific = T), bold = T)`). 

#### Table 2 excluding 10 participants who incorrectly answered the instructional item. 
```{r}
table2_excluding
```


Overall, we find mixed evidence that our explanatory warning decreases graph ratings for all judgments of differences, and strong evidence that an explanatory warning selectively decreases graph ratings for truncated graphs.

### Methods (Supplemental Information)

#### Participants (Supplemental Information)

```{r supplemental participant information language}
langauge <- demographic_df %>% 
  group_by(dem_language) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

other_language <- demographic_df %>% 
  group_by(dem_language_2_TEXT) %>%

```


`r text_spec(langauge[1,]$n, bold = T)` participants reported English as their first language, and `r text_spec(other_language[2,]$n, bold = T)` reported `r text_spec(other_language[2,]$dem_language_2_TEXT, bold = T)` as their first language. 


```{r supplemental participant information education}

education
   
```

`r text_spec(round(sum(education[education$dem_ed >= 5,]$percentage)), bold = T)`% of participants reported having at least a Bachelorâ€™s degree. 


```{r supplemental participant information duration}

Estimating 95% CIs for betas below This estimation fails to converge, so we reverted back to including only participant as a random effect. This does not alter the conclusions from this model.

Truncation effect is mean rating for truncated graphs - mean rating for control graphs. 

```{r}
ggplot(models_difference_df, aes(x = dem_age, y = difference))+
  geom_smooth(method = lm, color = "#510D73", fill = "#510D73") +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7)+

##### Interaction with warning


```{r age and subject condition}
# age and subject condition 
age_subjectcondition <- lm(difference ~ dem_age * subject_condition, models_difference_df)
summary(age_subjectcondition)

#### Item Analysis (Supplemental Information)

##### Main Effect of Warning
Here we summarise the data for each item. This is helpful to identify if the effect is driven by a few graphs or if it is seen across all graphs in the materials. 

```{r item analysis}
item_mean_df <- rating_df %>% 
  group_by(question,subject_condition) %>% 
  summarise(item_mean_rating = mean(rating)) %>% 
  arrange(question)
```

```{r}
item_mean_df %>% 
  spread(subject_condition, item_mean_rating) %>%
  mutate(diff=`no warning`- warning)
```

```{r}
item_mean_summary <- item_mean_df %>% 
  spread(subject_condition, item_mean_rating) %>%
  mutate(diff=`no warning`- warning) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), mean = mean(diff), sd = sd(diff), 
            median = median(diff), min= min(abs(diff)), 
            max = max(abs(diff)), 
            range = max(abs(diff))-min(abs(diff)))

item_mean_summary
```


```{r}
ggplot(rating_df, aes(x = subject_condition, y = rating, group = subject_condition, color = subject_condition))+
  geom_jitter(width = 0.23, alpha = 0.5)+
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point", color = "black") + 
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, color="black", geom="line", aes(group = 1))+
  facet_wrap(~as.factor(question))+
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Dark2", direction=-1)

# ggsave("../figures/figureSI3_item_analysis.png", device = "png", width = 16, height = 8, plot = last_plot(),scale = 1)
```

```{r}
item_mean_df %>% 
  spread(subject_condition, item_mean_rating) %>%
  mutate(diff=`no warning`- warning) %>% 
  filter(diff <0)
```


The effect of warning was observed for all graphs except graph 2, 12 and 40. On average, the 7-point ratings were `r text_spec(round(item_mean_summary$mean,2), bold = T)` (SD = `r text_spec(round(item_mean_summary$sd,2), bold = T)`) higher when graphs were seen in the no warning condition than when they were seen in the warning condition. The maximum average absolute difference between the no warning and the warningconditions was for graph 7 M = `r text_spec(round(item_mean_summary$max,2), bold = T)`. The minimum average absolute difference was for graph 2 where M = `r text_spec(round(item_mean_summary$min,2), bold = T)`.


##### Warning interaction with graph type 

```{r}
rating_df %<>% 
  mutate(subject_graph = paste(subject_condition, graph_condition))
```

```{r}
ggplot(rating_df, aes(x = graph_condition, y = rating, group = subject_condition, color = subject_condition))+
  geom_jitter(width = 0.23, alpha = 0.5)+
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point", color = "black", aes(group = subject_condition)) + 
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="line", aes(group = subject_condition))+
  facet_wrap(~as.factor(question))+
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Dark2", direction=-1)

# ggsave("../figures/figureSI3_item_analysis_warning.png", device = "png", width = 16, height = 8, plot = last_plot(),scale = 1)
```

#### Timing (Supplemental Information)

```{r supplemental information timing}

Trimming <- FALSE

if(Trimming == TRUE){timing_t_df = trimmed_timing_df
} else{timing_t_df = timing_df}
```


Timing information is in seconds. 

You can choose to trim or not timing data. By default any timing that is 2 standard deviations away from the mean (for each participant for each condition) is trimmed. 

For this report, any timing that is 2 standard deviations away from the mean (for each participant for each condition) `r if(Trimming == TRUE){paste("WAS")} else{paste("WAS NOT")}` trimmed.  If you want to see results when participants who got the exercise wrong are excluded/included, you can go to the section called Exclusions (at the top of this file) and change **Trimming <- FALSE**


```{r timing interaction}
subject_timing <-  timing_t_df %>%
  filter(question != "instructions") %>% 
  group_by(participantID, graph_condition, subject_condition) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), subject_mean_timing = mean(time))


#Data Summary
subject_timing_interaction_summary <- subject_timing %>% 
  group_by(subject_condition, graph_condition) %>%

            sd = sd(subject_mean_timing), 
            median = median(subject_mean_timing), min= min(subject_mean_timing), 
            max = max(subject_mean_timing), 
            range = max(subject_mean_timing)-min(subject_mean_timing))
